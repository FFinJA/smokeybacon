        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <img src="images/smokey-bacon-jam-jar.jpg" style="width:10%;">
            <p>Our journey began with our specialty—Smokey Bacon Jam—which our founder made and sold from her home kitchen. As the small operation grew into a successful business, the need to expand our horizons became apparent.</p>
            <p>In 2023, Smokey Bacon opened in Downtown Montreal to bring you our famous bacon jam, as well as an expanded menu full of mouth-watering bacon dishes. From appetizers to desserts, you will find a nice variety to satisfy your bacon cravings.</p>
            <p>Every meal comes with a sample of our signature Smokey Bacon Jam. If you love it as much as we do, we sell plenty of different formats if you wish to bring some home.</p>
        <h2>Our Team</h2>
            <p>Our dedicated team is currently composed of five people, all of whom work hard every day to provide you the quality bacon and customer service you've come to expect.</p>
