				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<h2>Our Story</h2>
					<img src="images/smokey-bacon-jam-jar.jpg" style="width:90%;">
					<p>Our journey began with our specialty—Smokey Bacon Jam—which our founder made and sold from her home kitchen. As the small operation grew into a successful business, the need to expand our horizons became apparent.</p>
					<p>In 2023, Smokey Bacon opened in Downtown Montreal to bring you our famous bacon jam, as well as an expanded menu full of mouth-watering bacon dishes. From appetizers to desserts, you will find a nice variety to satisfy your bacon cravings.</p>
					<p>Every meal comes with a sample of our signature Smokey Bacon Jam. If you love it as much as we do, we sell plenty of different formats if you wish to bring some home.</p>
				<h2>Our Team</h2>
					<p>Our dedicated team is currently composed of five people, all of whom work hard every day to provide you the quality bacon and customer service you've come to expect.</p>
					<h3>Tamara - Owner & Founder</h3>
					<p>Manages the buisness overall and started the company from her home kitchen.</p>
					<h3>Mederick - Restaurant Manager</h3>
					<p>Manages the day-to-day operations of the restaurant and assists staff when necessary.</p>
					<h3>Sesen - Chef</h3>
					<p>Works on-site in the kitchen preparing recipes for clients and creates new recipes.</p>
					<h3>Felix - Server</h3>
					<p>Serves customers at the counter and at their tables with a smile every day.</p>
					<h3>Jay - Accountant</h3>
